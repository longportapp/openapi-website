/**
 * Post-build script: copies directory-based routes to flat file routes.
 *
 * The deployment server handles .html differently from .md:
 *   - .html: /skill/install resolves to either install.html or install/index.html
 *   - .md:   no such redirect; install.md and install/index.md are distinct paths
 *
 * This script ensures both locations exist for each target route.
