# longbridge tui

Launch the interactive full-screen terminal UI — a real-time trading dashboard with watchlist
management, live candlestick charts, portfolio view, and stock search. Vim-style keybindings.

## Basic Usage

```bash
longbridge tui
```

## Examples

### Monitor a watchlist in real time

The TUI opens your watchlist and shows live price ticks, change percentages, and volume.
Navigate between stocks with `j`/`k` or arrow keys.

### View candlestick charts

Press `Enter` on any symbol to open the stock detail view with a live K-line chart.
Switch between timeframes with `1m`, `5m`, `1h`, `1d` keybindings.

### Search and add symbols

Press `/` to open the search overlay. Type a symbol name or code to find and add it to
your watchlist.

## Notes

- Requires a valid `longbridge login` session
- The TUI shares the same token as CLI commands
- Press `q` or `Ctrl+C` to quit
