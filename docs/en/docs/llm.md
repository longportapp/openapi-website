# LLM Components

We provide several components for LLMs (Large Language Models) that allow you to easily access and analyze financial data, real-time market data, and even enable AI to place orders.

Yes, you can use our LLM components through the Longbridge Developers. Start today!

## LLMs Text

The OpenAPI documentation follows the [LLMs Text](https://llmstxt.org/) standard, providing [llms.txt](https://open.longbridge.com/llms.txt) and Markdown files for each document. Based on this LLMs Text, you can provide AI with a complete dictionary of Longbridge Developers documentation as a reference for AI-assisted development, enabling AI to generate more accurate code.

- [https://open.longbridge.com/llms.txt](https://open.longbridge.com/llms.txt) - Approximately 2104 tokens.

Each of our documents is also available in Markdown format. When accessing them, simply add the `.md` suffix to the URL.

For example:

- https://open.longbridge.com/docs/getting-started.md
- https://open.longbridge.com/docs/quote/pull/static.md

## Longbridge.com Markdown Access (AI-friendly)

In addition to OpenAPI docs, pages on [https://longbridge.com](https://longbridge.com) are also AI-friendly for markdown retrieval.

You can get markdown content in either way:

1. Add `.md` suffix to page URL
2. Send request header: `Accept: text/markdown`

Examples:

- `https://longbridge.com/en/pricing.md`
- `curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://longbridge.com/quote/TSLA.US`

This is useful for LLM crawlers, RAG indexing, and tool-based content ingestion while keeping page structure clean.

Next, in an AI conversation, you can select the Docs you just added under the `docs` menu of **@Add Context**. This allows the AI to use these documents as context in subsequent conversations.
