## Q1: Do I need to open a live account to call LongPort OpenAPI?

A: We provide a paper account, you can use it to complete the debugging of the OpenAPI quote and trading interfaces.

## Q2: How to open a paper account for debugging?

A: Please visit [Development Center](/account/) to enable the paper account and obtain the corresponding App Key & Secret and Access Token.

## Q3: Are the trading permissions for simulation debugging the same as for real accounts?

A: Quote is the same, trading might be different.

Paper accounts and live accounts share the same App Key & Secret, but have different Access Tokens. Quote permissions are associated with the App Key & Secret, while trading permissions are associated with the Access Token. Therefore, under paper accounts and live accounts, quote permissions are the same, but trading permissions are associated with the securities account and may differ.
